Forensic Artifact Parser and Analyzer for Custom Logs
 

⟩ Project Overview

This project is a Python-based forensic utility designed to parse, analyze, and visualize custom log files from a simulated, non-standard operating system. The tool supports digital investigators in decoding raw log data, identifying critical system events, detecting anomalies, and presenting visual insights for further interpretation.


⟩ Significance of Log File Analysis in Digital Forensic Investigation

Log files are crucial sources of digital evidence. They serve as chronological records of system and user activity, making them essential for:

» Reconstructing Events : Logs help recreate a sequence of actions taken on a system, including file access, logins, software execution, and system errors.

» Identifying Malicious Activity : By analyzing patterns and irregularities, forensic investigators can detect suspicious behaviors like unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.

» Corroborating Evidence : Logs can support or contradict statements during an investigation and provide timestamped evidence in legal contexts.

» Attribution and Accountability : They help attribute actions to specific users or processes, thus strengthening accountability.

» Incident Response : Effective log analysis aids in understanding the scope of a security incident and in forming preventive measures.


⟩ Key Features

» Custom Log Parsing : Supports extraction of structured data from non-standard log formats.

» Event Classification : Automatically categorizes events like user activity, process executions, and file interactions.

» Anomaly Detection : Detects unusual patterns or rule violations within the data.

» Timeline Generation: Builds a chronological event sequence to trace system activity.

» Data Visualization : Presents insights through graphs and interactive charts for easy interpretation.
